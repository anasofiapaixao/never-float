# never-float
anti css floating library

A library for developers who are sick of the use of float inlining in 2019.

never-float was conceived with the goal of helping people leave the ghost of IE6, the last browser to not support inline-block or flex, well enough alone.

If somebody has put this as a dependency in your project, you probably deserved it. If you did it yourself as a sort of penance, you probably deserved it too.

## Installing from npm
`npm install never-float`

## Importing to your project
`import 'never-float';` ES6 style import

`require('never-float');` CommonJS style import

Issues and PRs welcome!
