# never-float
anti css floating library

A library for developers who are sick of the use of float inlining in 2019.

never-float was conceived with the goal of helping people leave the ghost of IE6, the last browser to not support inline-block or flex, well enough alone.

## Installing from npm
`npm install never-float`

## Importing to your project
`import neverFloat from 'never-float'` ES6 style import

`require('never-float')` CommonJS style import

Issues and PRs welcome!
